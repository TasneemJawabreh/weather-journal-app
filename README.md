## description
This project is an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. The majority of the functionality was implemented in the JavaScript files. First, I set up a Node.js environment with Express to handle server requests and responses.then  I created an asynchronous function to fetch weather data from the API and update the UI. The temperature is originally provided in Kelvin, so I converted it to Celsius. Error handling is also included to manage invalid input or API errors.
